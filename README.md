# Graphics
My attempt at OpenGL graphics
I have no idea what this will end up as, but it's a bit of fun and something to do.

The previous goal has been to condense all the information needed to draw a textured rectangle (composed of 2 triangles) into a single structure.
The latest goal has been to make a single function, drawStruct(), that takes a structure as its sole argument and then draw it onto the screen.

The next goal is to make an array of this type of structure, and a function that takes this array of structures, then draws them all in turn, in the order they appear in the array.



Apparently including \*.c files instead of \*.h files is not good.
I don't care.
It works, so it stays.
