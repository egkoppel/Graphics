# Graphics
My attempt at OpenGL graphics
I have no idea what this will end up as, but it's a bit of fun and something to do.
The previous goal has been to condense all the information needed to draw a textured rectangle (composed of 2 triangles) into a single structure.
The latest goal has been to make a single function, drawStruct(), that takes a structure as its sole argument and then draw it onto the screen.
